Radar and LiDAR Fusion for Object Detection and Tracking

This project is a MATLAB simulation that integrates **Radar** and **LiDAR** sensor data to perform robust object detection and tracking. By combining the strengths of both sensors—Radar's reliability in distance measurement and LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial data—the system achieves accurate state estimation using a **Kalman Filter**.
